Account Management: Create and manage multiple bank accounts with unique identifiers.
Secure Transactions: Ensure safe and accurate deposit and withdrawal operations.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for ease of use and accessibility.
Transaction History: Log and view detailed transaction records.
Technology Stack:

Core Features and Libraries

Core Java:

Java Collections Framework: For managing lists of users, transactions, and accounts (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap).
Java I/O: For reading/writing files if the project uses flat file storage.
Java Streams: For processing collections and improving performance.

Database Interaction:

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For basic database operations.
Hibernate ORM: Simplifies database interaction with object-relational mapping.
HikariCP: A high-performance JDBC connection pooling library.

Encryption and Security:

Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA): For encryption, hashing, and secure data storage (e.g., MessageDigest for hashing passwords).
Bouncy Castle: Advanced cryptographic operations.

Testing:

JUnit 5: For unit testing core functionality.
Mockito: For mocking dependencies in unit tests.

Web and API Development
If you're planning to make the system a web-based application:

Web Framework:

Spring Boot: Simplifies building REST APIs, MVC web apps, and microservices.
Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE): For building enterprise-grade web applications.

Templating and Frontend Integration:

Thymeleaf: For server-side rendering of dynamic HTML pages.
JSP/Servlets: For basic web applications.

API Documentation:

Swagger (SpringDoc): For auto-generating REST API documentation.
Database Management

Relational Databases:
MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle Database.
Use Hibernate ORM or Spring Boot's JPA for database mapping.

In-Memory Databases (optional for testing):
H2 Database: Lightweight and fast for development and testing.

Build and Dependency Management
Maven: For managing dependencies and building the project.
Gradle: An alternative to Maven, known for better performance.

Development Tools
IDE: Use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development.
Version Control: Use Git and platforms like GitHub to manage your code.
